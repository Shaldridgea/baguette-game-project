# Baguette

**Baguette is a cartoony 2D action/management game about making bread with unique controls, where you control the player's hands individually.**

This project is a vertical slice originally made in 2020 as a proof-of-concept, and **targets Unity LTS version 2021.3.44f1**.

All art assets made by me.

Notable features and systems:
- Unconventional player controls and perspective
- Variety of tools and interactable items using these controls
- Targeted component caching class for fast access, bypassing GetComponent
- Managers simulating day and time, and supply/demand
- Upgrade system with automatically updating values, removing manual checks or per-script event subscribing
- Custom input manager with rebinding
- Extensive UI work and menus with audio and input settings, and custom UI scripts
